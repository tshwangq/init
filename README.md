# init
initial files for my workstation.
the purpose of this repo is to make a unique & scriptable working env. 

# workstation model?
	* single disk (usb3 + ssd ) aka master disk, couple of machines/notebook in office/home. 
	* machines will not hold any data. only provide basic os host + virtualbox+vagrant.
	* any work should get done in guest os. in case the host machine has a low cpus/mem, using emacs 

# data strategy
	* public data goes to github
	* private data goes to dropbox in the master disk.
    * .gnupg save in dropbox, link to home
	* private data crypt with gnupg(.gpg)
